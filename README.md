### Tic Tac Toe

To simplify the cooperation we used a `.py` file to merge our work easily. In the end we extracted it into a notebook but it doesn't store the results. Nevertheless you can run the notebook easily since we saved all the results needed to show the graph in `saved_result`. 


You can rederive every results bu setting `LOAD_RESULT` to `False`.
